# Frontend Code Challenge

## Getting Started

In the project directory you can:

### Run `npm install`
This will install the app's dependencies.

### Run `npm start`
This starts the development server (React app). You can view the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Run `npm start server.js`
This will start the barebones Express server being used as a mock backend.

### `npm test`

This starts the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## Notes
