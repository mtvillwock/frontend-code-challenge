# Frontend Code Challenge

## Getting Started

In the `src` directory you can:

### Run `npm install`
This will install the app's dependencies.

### Run `npm start`
This starts the development server (React app). You can view the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Run `node server.js`
This starts the barebones Express server being used as a mock backend.

### `npm test`

This starts the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## Improvements For Later
- Convert to TypeScript instead of using PropTypes
- Simplify form state logic from [booleans to enums](https://kyleshevlin.com/enumerate-dont-booleanate)?
- Integrate with Python backend
